title: Pro tip: Save your work!
---

This special version of Scratch allows you to access your machine learning model, as well as use the music database blocks. **But: if you try to open your project in another version of Scratch online, it won’t work.** 

A solution you can use is to save your work to your computer:

--- task ---

First, give your program a name. Type the name of your program in the project name box at the top of the screen:

--- task ---

To save your project, click on **File**, and then on **Save to your computer**:

![Selecting 'Save to your computer' in the 'File' menu.](images/save.png)

Your Scratch `.sb3`  file will be saved to your computer. 

--- /task ---

Once you have the .sb3 file for your project saved, you can open it again later, or on another computer:
+ Go to [rpf.io/mlscratch](rpf.io/mlscratch){:target="_blank"} to get to this special fork of Scratch 
+ Once Scratch opens choose **File** > **Load from your computer**
+ Select your file in the window that appears to get back to where you left off

Save your work as often as you can to make sure you don’t lose any progress!

+ Your answers to the questions:
     - What is your project? What does it do, in your own words? 
     - What did you find difficult about making it? How did you overcome those challenges?
     - If you had more time, what would you change or add to your application?
     - Could your application be used to influence or harm people if someone used it in a way you didn't intend? If so, how could you stop that from happening?
