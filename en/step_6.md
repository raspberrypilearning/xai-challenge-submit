## Share - Submit your app

The final step in your Experience AI Music Quest is to share your amazing efforts with us, and the community of other creators participating around the world!


### Complete the submission form

Before you begin the process, make sure you have access to the following things (you need to attach them to the form!):

+ Your finished model card, with all the fields filled in.

+ A finished scratch project which creates themed playlists using a trained ML model on ML4Kids

+ A finished scratch project which classifies song data into an ML model on ML4Kids

+ Your answers to the questions:
     - What is your project? What does it do, in your own words? 
     - What did you find difficult about making it? How did you overcome those challenges?
     - If you had more time, what would you change or add to your application?
     - If someone knew about your application and wanted to use it in a way you didnâ€™t intend, can you think of a way they could use it to harm or influence others? If so, how could you stop that from happening?
