## What next?

## Congratulations!

You have reached the end of the Experience AI Challenge!

If you're want to try more ML and AI activities, check out the worksheets on the [Machine Learning for Kids](https://machinelearningforkids.co.uk/#!/worksheets) site and have a go at one that looks cool. Or have a look at Teachable Machine, another machine learning platform for young people.

You can bring all your ideas to life in Scratch, using your new coding skills! Try using Scratch to make more cool stuff! If you need a reminder of what you have learnt, you can go to the [Scratch guide](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/getting-started-scratch), have a go at one of our fun [paths](rpf.io/paths), and make something else awesome!

Also, before you forget, enter your awesome Experience AI Challenge app into the **Coolest Projects Global Showcase** so the whole world can see your amazing inventions!
