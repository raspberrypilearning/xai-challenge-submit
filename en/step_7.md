## What next?

## Congratulations!

You have reached the end of the Experience AI Challenge!

If you're still looking for more ML and AI activities, you can look for a `worksheet` that seems cool on the [Machine Learning for Kids](https://machinelearningforkids.co.uk/#!/worksheets) site, or have a go at Teachable Machine, another Machine Learning platform for young people.

You can bring all your ideas to life in Scratch, using your new coding skills! Try using Scratch to make more cool stuff! If you need a reminder of what you have learned, you can go to the [Scratch guide](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/getting-started-scratch), have a go at one of our fun [paths](rpf.io/paths) and make something else awesome!

Also, before you forget - enter your awesome Experience AI Challenge app into the **Coolest Projects Global Showcase** so the whole world can see your amazing inventions!

Keep on making cool stuff!
