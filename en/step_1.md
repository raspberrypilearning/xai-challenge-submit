## Introduction

You are going to create a machine learning model and an application that uses it. 

Your machine learning app will need to meet the **project brief**.

<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">
A <span style="color: #0faeb0">project brief</span> describes what a project must do. It's a bit like being given a mission to complete.
</p>

You will:
  + Build a machine learning model on Machine Learning for Kids with multiple **classes**
  + Collect relevant **training data** for each class in your classification model
  + Train your machine learning model on your collected training data
  + Build a classifier application in Scratch that uses your model to solve a problem

### PROJECT BRIEF: Machine learning classification app
<hr style="border-top: 2px solid black;">

Create a machine learning application in Scratch that you can use to solve a problem you care about. 

**Your machine learning classification application should:**
1. Use Machine Learning for Kids in conjunction with Scratch to create a classification tool
2. Have a clear user interface (UI) that helps users understand how to use the application
3. Showcase the use of at least one type of data for classification: audio, image, or text
4. Be user-friendly and intuitive, ensuring that users without prior machine learning knowledge can interact with the tool
5. Provide feedback to the user on the prediction made by the classifier in an easy-to-understand manner

**Your ML classification application could...**
1. Incorporate more than one type of data classification, combining audio, image, or text
2. Feature creative themes or settings, like a superhero world, a mystical forest, or an underwater adventure
3. Incorporate animations, sounds, or visual effects that are triggered depending on the prediction made by the classifier
4. Allow users to customise or personalise the application, like choosing avatars or setting preferred themes

title: The Design Thinking Process
---


Hey, future world-changers! Ever wondered how the coolest apps, games, or even roller coasters are made? Enter the magical world of **design thinking**!

**Why do we use design thinking?**  
Imagine you're baking a cake for the first time. You wouldn't just throw random ingredients into a bowl, right? You'd want a recipe, a plan! Design thinking is like that recipe, but for creating whatever cool stuff you want. It helps people make things that everyone loves and finds useful.

**What's it for?**  
Design thinking is all about understanding what people need. It's how you find out what will make your intended audience go "WOW!" and then crafting that perfect thing for them. Whether it's a new toy, a video game, or even a space rocket, design thinking helps dreamers like you turn wild ideas into real, awesome things.

**How's design thinking used in the real world?**  
Big companies like Apple, Disney, and even NASA, use design thinking! They chat with people (just like you and me) to understand what would make their lives more fun or easier. Then, they brainstorm, sketch, build, and test until they've made something amazing. It's like how game designers create levels in a video game, testing and tweaking until it's just right.

So, next time you dream of creating the next big thing, remember design thinking. It's the secret ingredient that turns "What if?" into "Ta-da! Look what I made!" 🚀🎉


### The process

This is an overview of the whole Design Thinking process, in case you need to look at the 'bigger picture' while making your ML application (questions are provided to help you get started in the next step!):

---

### 1. Empathise: Understand your audience
📌 **What's it about?** 
Imagine you're watching a movie, and you're trying to figure out how the main character feels. That's empathy! In design, it means understanding what others need or struggle with.
📌 **What to do**: 
Chat with friends or classmates. Ask them about apps they love or hate and why. It's like gathering clues and the more clues you have, the closer you can get to making exactly what people want!

---

### 2. Define: Pinpoint the challenge
📌 **What's it about?** 
This step is about finding that one main challenge or problem from all the feedback you've gathered.
📌 **What to do**: 
Review your notes. What's that one thing everyone keeps talking about? That's your mission! Write it down as your main challenge.

---

### 3. Ideate: Unleash your creativity
📌 **What's it about?** 
Think of this as a brainstorming party! No idea is too wild. It's like suggesting toppings for a pizza - the crazier, the better!
📌 **What to do**: 
Grab some colourful pens and paper. Write or draw every idea that pops into your head. Maybe an app that dances? Or sings? Go wild!

---

### 4. Prototype: Craft Your blueprint
📌 **What's it about?** 
You know how superheroes have origin stories? This is your app's origin story — forge a basic version to show the world.
📌 **What to do**: 
Sketch or doodle how your app might look. It doesn't have to be perfect. It's like drawing a comic strip of your app's journey.

**4a. Choose a Dataset:**
📌 **What's It About?** 
Just as athletes need training to get better, your model needs data for its training. 
📌 **What to do**: 
Search for cool datasets online at places like [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/){:target="_blank"}, find one that matches your mission and upload it to your ML model for training. Or, make your own dataset like you did in the previous stage! It's like choosing the right ingredients for a magic potion.

**4b. Train the Model:**
📌 **What's It About?** 
Using [Machine Learning 4 Kids](https://machinelearningforkids.co.uk/){:target="_blank"}," it's time to train your model. Think of it as a study session, but for your Machine Learning model.
📌 **What to do**: 
Upload your dataset to [Machine Learning 4 Kids](https://machinelearningforkids.co.uk/){:target="_blank"} and start the training. 

**4c. Build in Scratch:**
📌 **What's It About?** 
You've trained your model, and now it's showtime! It's like giving your favorite Scratch sprite a brand new skill using the power of Machine Learning.
📌 **What to do**: 
Jump back into [Scratch](https://scratch.machinelearningforkids.co.uk/){:target="_blank"} and start building your project. With the skills you've got, connect your trained model from Machine Learning 4 Kids to Scratch. Remember how you made sprites move and talk? Now, the sprite can 'learn' too! Maybe your sprite can identify what animal you're thinking of, distinguish between different sounds, or respond to different objects you show it. The sky's the limit! Test it out, tweak, and have a blast watching your creation operate with its new digital brainpower!

### 5. Test: Let Your Friends Take It for a Spin
📌 **What's It About?** 
You've built an amazing machine learning application. Now, it's time for your friends to use it and tell you what they think of it.
📌 **What to do**: 
Share your app with friends. Get their honest opinions. Try using the `Two ⭐s and a Wish` format: get your feedback in the form of two things your testers like about your app, and one thing they wish was different.

---

### 6. Iterate: Upgrade and shine
📌 **What's It About?** 
Got feedback? Great! Now, make your app even cooler by carefully considering the suggestions. 
📌 **What to do**: 
List the feedback and tweak your app. Maybe your users wished that they could customise your game character with new outfits and powers, or suggested that you could make the instructions clearer. 

---

### 7. Finalize: Get Ready for the Spotlight
📌 **What's It About?** 
You're about to launch your masterpiece.
📌 **What to do**: 
Double-check everything. Make it look and feel awesome. Think about how you want to present your app and ML model, and fill out a 'model card' explaining your ML model. Then, unveil it to the world by submitting to us!

---

### 8. Reflect and share: Tell your epic tale
📌 **What's it about?** 
Every hero has a story. Share yours. How did you turn an idea into this cool app?
📌 **What to do**: 
Fill out the submission form, including your answers to the 'magic questions', and your model card explaining your machine learning model. Shortlisted entrants will be invited to a special event for awesome AI architects!

In the next step, you'll start to plan your machine learning app using the Empathise, Define, and Ideate stages of the design thinking process. 

## Lets get making!
