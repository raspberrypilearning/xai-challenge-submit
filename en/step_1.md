## Introduction

You are going to create a machine learning model and an application that uses it. 

Your machine learning app will need to meet the **project brief**.

<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">
A <span style="color: #0faeb0">project brief</span> describes what a project must do. It's a bit like being given a mission to complete.
</p>

You will:
  + Build a machine learning model on Machine Learning for Kids with multiple **classes**
  + Collect relevant **training data** for each class in your classification model
  + Train your machine learning model on your collected training data
  + Build a classifier application in Scratch that uses your model to solve a problem

### PROJECT BRIEF: Machine learning classification app
<hr style="border-top: 2px solid black;">

Create a machine learning application in Scratch that solves a problem you care about. 

**Your machine learning classification application should:**
1. Use Machine Learning for Kids in conjunction with Scratch to create a classification tool
2. Have a clear user interface (UI) that helps users understand how to use the application
3. Showcase the use of at least one type of data for classification: audio, image, or text
4. Be user-friendly and intuitive, ensuring that users without prior machine learning knowledge can interact with the tool
5. Provide feedback to the user on the classification results in an easy-to-understand manner

**Your ML classification application could...**
1. Incorporate more than one type of data classification, blending audio, image, or text
2. Feature creative themes or settings, like a superhero world, a mystical forest, or an underwater adventure
3. Incorporate animations, sounds, or visual effects that are triggered by the classification results
4. Allow users to customise or personalise the application, like choosing avatars or setting preferred themes
