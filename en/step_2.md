## The Design Thinking Process

Hey future world-changers! Ever wondered how the coolest apps, games, or even roller coasters are made? Enter the magical world of **design thinking**!

**Why do we use it?**  
Imagine you're baking a cake for the first time. You wouldn't just throw random ingredients into a bowl, right? You'd want a recipe, a plan! Design thinking is like that recipe, but for creating super cool stuff. It helps people make things that everyone loves and finds useful.

**What's it for?**  
Design thinking is all about understanding what people need. It's like being a detective, figuring out what would make your intended audience go "WOW!" and then crafting that perfect thing for them. Whether it's a new toy, a video game, or even a space rocket, design thinking helps dreamers like you turn wild ideas into real, awesome things.

**How's it used in the big world?**  
Big companies, like Apple, Disney, and even NASA, use design thinking! They chat with people (just like you and me) to understand what would make their lives more fun or easier. Then, they brainstorm, sketch, test, and build until they've made something amazing. It's like how game designers create levels in a video game, testing and tweaking until it's just right.

So, next time you dream of creating the next big thing, remember design thinking. It's the secret sauce that turns "What if?" into "Ta-da! Look what I made!" 🚀🎉


### The Process

**1. Empathize: Dive into Others' Shoes**
📌 **What's It About?** 
Imagine you're watching a movie, and you're trying to figure out what the main character feels. That's empathy! In design, it means understanding what others need or struggle with.
📌 **Your Move**: 
Chat with friends or classmates. Ask them about apps they love or hate and why. It's like gathering clues in a detective game. The more clues, the closer you get to cracking the case!

**2. Define: Pinpoint the Challenge**
📌 **What's It About?** 
Remember those puzzles where you find the hidden objects? This step is about finding that one main challenge or problem from all the feedback you've gathered.
📌 **Your Move**: 
Review your notes. What's that one thing everyone keeps talking about? That's your mission! Write it down as your main challenge.

**3. Ideate: Unleash Your Creativity**
📌 **What's It About?** 
Think of this as a brainstorming party! No idea is too wild. It's like suggesting toppings for a pizza - the crazier, the better!
📌 **Your Move**: 
Grab some colorful pens and paper. Write or draw every idea that pops into your head. Maybe an app that dances? Or sings? Go wild!

**4. Prototype: Craft Your Blueprint**
📌 **What's It About?** 
You know how superheroes have origin stories? This is your app's origin story — forge a basic version to show the world.
📌 **Your Move**: 
Sketch or doodle how your app might look. It doesn't have to be perfect. It's like drawing a comic strip of your app's journey.

    **4a. Choose a Dataset: Pick Your Brain Food**
    📌 **What's It About?** 
    Just like you need food to grow, your app needs data to learn. It's like feeding it its favorite snacks.
    📌 **Your Move**: 
    Search for cool datasets online at places like [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/){:target="_blank"}, find one that matches your mission and feed it to your ML model. Or, make your own dataset like you did in the previous stage! It's like choosing the right ingredients for a magic potion.

    **4b. Train the Model: Gym Time for Your App**
    📌 **What's It About?** 
    Using [Machine Learning 4 Kids](https://machinelearningforkids.co.uk/){:target="_blank"}," it's time to train your app. Think of it as a workout session, but for your app.
    📌 **Your Move**: 
    Upload your dataset to [Machine Learning 4 Kids](https://machinelearningforkids.co.uk/){:target="_blank"} and start the training. It's like teaching your pet some new tricks!

    **4c. Integrate in Scratch: Power Up Your Project**
    📌 **What's It About?** 
    You've trained your model, and now it's showtime! It's like giving your favorite Scratch sprite a brand new superpower using the magic of Machine Learning.
    📌 **Your Move**: 
    Jump back into [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/){:target="_blank"} and open up your project. With the skills you've got, connect your trained model from Machine Learning 4 Kids to Scratch. Remember how you made sprites move and talk? Now, they can think too! Maybe your sprite can guess the animal you're thinking of, or it can react to different objects you show it. The sky's the limit! Test it out, tweak, and have a blast watching your creation come to life with its new brainpower!

**5. Test: Let Your Friends Take It for a Spin**
📌 **What's It About?** 
You've built a mini roller coaster. Now, it's time for your friends to ride it and tell you how it feels.
📌 **Your Move**: 
Share your app with friends. Get their honest opinions. It's like a taste test for a new ice cream flavor. Try using the `Two ⭐s and a Wish` format: get your feedback in the form of two things your testers like about your app, and one thing they wish was different.

**6. Iterate: Upgrade and Shine**
📌 **What's It About?** 
Got feedback? Great! Now, make your app even cooler. It's like leveling up in a video game.
📌 **Your Move**: 
List the feedback. Tweak your app like customizing your game character with new outfits and powers, or make the instructions clearer.

**7. Finalize: Get Ready for the Spotlight**
📌 **What's It About?** 
You're about to launch your masterpiece. It's like the grand premiere of your movie.
📌 **Your Move**: 
Double-check everything. Make it look and feel awesome. Think about how you want to present your app and ML model, then fill out a 'model card' explaining your ML model. Then, unveil it to the world by submitting to us!

---

**8. Reflect and Share: Tell Your Epic Tale**
📌 **What's It About?** 
Every hero has a story. Share yours. How did you turn an idea into this cool app?
📌 **Your Move**: 
Fill out the submission form, including your answers to the 'magic questions', and your model card explaining your ML model. Shortlisted entrants will be invited to a special event for awesome AI architects with Google Deepmind, the world's leading AI research company!
